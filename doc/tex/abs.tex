            The purpose of this project is to find an alternative and more 
            user friendly way of installing and controlling a sun panel 
            manufactured by Parans Solar Lighting. As of today the panel is 
            installed and controlled by connecting it to a computer, 
            which has to be correctly configured and able to run a terminal 
            where commands are sent to the panel. The aim of this project is 
            to develop a hand held device which is easy to connect and has 
            buttons that execute the commands needed to install and control 
            the panel. The resulting device is a Raspberry Pi with an attached
            touchscreen, running a software developed in \texttt{Python}.  
            The conclusion is that such a device is easily created with standard
            hardware, although this results in a large device 
            compared to other touchscreen devices such as smartphones.
