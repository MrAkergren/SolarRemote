	\section*{Background and Aim} % (fold)
	\label{sec:background_and_aim}
    	As one of few companies in the world, Parans has a unique technology where they deliver natural sunlight through optical fiber cables. Parans has business worldwide and their two currently biggest installations are found in Malaysia and Los Angeles. \\

    	\noindent Sunlight is focused into optical fiber cables via roof mounted panels with plastic lenses, and the panel is in turn controlled by two stepper motors. The steering is controlled both by input from an algorithm and from a sun sensor. The algorithm uses location data and current time to calculate the sun's position, while the sensor has a photocell which, in direct sunlight, gives accurate data to steer the panel to correct positions. In this way, the focus of the sunlight is always optimized. \\

        \noindent The panel is connected to a 12V power supply, and the system that controls it is written in C. When users want to install the panel they have to connect it to a laptop and give commands to the panel's system to set it in the right position. \\
        
        \noindent The communication between the panel and the laptop is done via a USB port and the commands are executed from a terminal. Not all customers are used to work in terminals and the use of personal laptops also cause problems. \\

        \noindent Our aim is therefore to develop a control pad which is easy to connect to the panels USB port and has buttons executing the commands needed for the installation of the Parans panel.

    \section*{Solution} % (fold)
    \label{sec:solution}
        The main issue in this project is to develop a device that will be able to communicate with the panel. \\

        \noindent One problem that most likely will arise is the connection over a serial link and what ways there are to handle this type of communication.

        The solution to this will be to read up on this type of communication and see how others have solved the issue. We will also be able to test our method by connecting our device to a panel available to us in the company office.\\

        \noindent As we have no previous experience with the Parans panel, we do not know how to set different commands over the serial link and then receive the reply, so that will be yet another problem. Because the panel and its controller is custom built by the company, documentation describing how the panel works is sparse.

        The solution to this will be to read the documentation provided to us by the company and to utilize the 'trial-and-error' approach.

        \newpage

        \noindent The likely result of this project will be a handheld device that will be able to communicate over a serial link to the company's panel. The device will be based on a so called 'System on a Chip' (SoC) running the Linux kernel, and it will be able to send commands with the push of a button. In addition, it will contain a screen that will be able to display requested information from the panel and the device will be connected by a USB-cable.

        A drawback of using an SoC as the base for the system is that our device can become relatively large compared to other devices for a similar purpose. The size will be dependent on the fact that SoC's are multipurpose units and contains ports that will be left unused. A touch screen device could be a better base system, but there are few of those that can act as USB-hosts and the cost would be higher than the SoC system. Another problem with touch screen devices is that the programming could become more difficult for our type of product.

   \section*{Organisation} % (fold)
	\label{sec:organisation}
		Members of the project are Johan Strand, Pär Svedberg and Oskar Åkergren, all third year Computer Science bachelor students at Chalmers Technical University. The group's members will alternate as project managers, having the role for one week at a time. Project managing aside, the group will share duties in researching, programming and documentation, and individual tasks will be derived from the project's milestones and democratically assigned. \\

		\noindent Information need to be gathered and read about the chose platform in order to gain understanding of how to best program and connect the devices. Documentation of the Parans SP3 will be provided by the company, and a solution for the SP3 and SoC devices to communicate needs to be found. \\
		
		\noindent The preliminary schedule is based on each member committing approximately 20 hours per week to the project.
