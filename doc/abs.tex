            The purpose of this research is to find an alternative, and more user friendly way of installing and controlling a sun panel manufactured by Parans Solar Lighting. As of today the panel is installed and controlled by connecting a computer to the panel, which have to be correctly configured and able to run a terminal where commands are sent to the panel. The aim of this report is to develop a hand held device which is easy to connect and has buttons that executes the commands needed to install and control the panel. The resulting device is a software developed in \texttt{Python}, running on a Raspberry Pi with an attached touchscreen. The device is connected to the panel via an USB cable and the user controls the panel by pressing the digital buttons on the touchscreen, and was developed using the Design Science Research methodology.
